echo ---   Kyverno AC Signing Policy Small POC in EKS
echo ---
echo ---   We will have some signed and unsigned doggy images in public ECR registry
echo ---   Kyverno will audit unsigned in the Red namespace, but block in the Blue namespace.
echo ---   Kyverno will allow signed in all namespaces
echo ---
echo ---   Requirements:
echo ---   - SYSDIG_API_TOKEN env var set
echo ---   - Kyverno installed via Helm
echo ---   - delete any doggy-signed or doggy-unsigned pods in the blue and red ns before proceeding
